# Usage

# Technical documentation

{% include sources_docs/SpiritedSpriteInfo.md %}

# Want to do more ?

The following technical demo runs in Ren'Py. Keep in mind that dynamically changing
Spirited's parameters as is done in the demo requires extensive knowledge of its
inner working at the moment. If you'd like the extension to provide the ability to
do this more easily with Ren'Py-compatible patterns, let us know by opening an issue on GitHub
so we can try to provide this feature if there is enough interest in it.
