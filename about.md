# About the extension

The development of Spirited started during a Game Jam and it seemed
promising and novel enough to be shared for use as an extension in
other Ren'Py project.

By the end of the Jam, pretty much all of the features of its first
release were already implemented, but it still needed a lot of ironing
and some fixes to integrate neatly with Ren'Py. Most notably, the screen
label integration was discovered and implemented at that time, as
well as the Ren'Py Extension packaging.

Get it now on [itch.io]({{ site.itch_link }}).

# About me

I'm a full-time developper and started working on Ren'Py during a break
as a way to pass time and keep myself occupied. I hope the extensions I
develop will prove usefull to many and welcome all feedback on them.

I occasionally stream on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/{{ site.twitch_username }}).
The stream's main language is french, but do not hesitate to hit me up in
english in the chat.
